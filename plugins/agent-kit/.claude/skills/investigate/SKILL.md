# 🔎 Investigate

**Issue:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## The Iron Law

**No conclusions without evidence.** A hypothesis without proof is a guess. Your job is to find and confirm the root cause — not to fix it. Source code changes are out of scope; this skill produces an Investigation Report that a developer or the `code` skill can act on.

---

## Phase 1: Symptoms & Reproduction

Gather evidence before forming any hypothesis.

1. **Capture baseline.** Record the current broken state before investigating: exact command run, full error/test output, stack trace, relevant logs with timestamps, and `git status --short`. This is the before-state that `code` must verify against after applying a fix.
2. **Collect symptoms.** Read error messages, stack traces, and steps to reproduce verbatim.
3. **Reproduce.** Confirm the issue is triggerable deterministically. If it is intermittent, document the conditions under which it appears.
4. **Localize the failing boundary.** Identify the smallest layer where the failure is visible: test harness, UI, API, job, database, dependency, configuration, environment, or external service.
5. **Reduce when the trigger is broad.** If the failing command, report, or user flow spans too much surface area, narrow it to the smallest test, input, route, fixture, request, or operation that still fails. Do not minimize for its own sake when the root cause is already directly exposed.
6. **Check history.** Run `git log --oneline -20 -- <affected-files>` to surface recent regressions.
7. **Trace the code path.** Starting from the localized failure, reduced repro, or stack trace, trace execution backwards through the call stack to the earliest contributing point.

While tracing, note which patterns in the Pattern Catalog the symptoms resemble — pattern recognition runs naturally alongside reading and need not wait for Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Pattern Match

Cross-reference your findings against the catalog. A matching pattern becomes the starting hypothesis. If multiple patterns match, rank by fit and investigate the strongest first.

Check `git log` for recurring fixes in the same area — a file patched repeatedly for similar issues signals an architectural smell, not a coincidence.

When the codebase contains a similar working path, compare against it before inventing a theory. List the meaningful differences in input shape, environment, configuration, call order, state, and dependencies. A known-good comparison is evidence; a generic pattern match is only a lead.

### Pattern Catalog

| Pattern | Signature | Where to look |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Race condition** | Intermittent, timing-dependent failures | Concurrent access to shared state |
| **Nil/null propagation** | `NoMethodError`, `TypeError`, `Cannot read properties of undefined` | Missing guards, unvalidated API responses |
| **State corruption** | Inconsistent data, partial updates | Transactions, callbacks, lifecycle hooks |
| **Integration failure** | Timeout, unexpected response shape | External API calls, service boundaries |
| **Configuration drift** | Works locally, fails in staging/prod | Env vars, feature flags, DB migrations |
| **Stale cache** | Shows old data, clears on flush | Redis, CDN, browser cache |
| **Off-by-one** | Wrong final element, fence-post errors | Loop bounds, index calculations, pagination |
| **Dependency conflict** | Works in isolation, fails when combined | Package versions, transitive dependencies |
| **Serialization failure** | Wrong shape, missing fields, type coercion | JSON parsing, API contracts, schema validation |
| **Auth/permission failure** | 401/403, silent access denial | Token expiry, scope checks, middleware order |

---

## Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

Form one specific, falsifiable hypothesis at a time.

1. **State the hypothesis.** "The root cause is X because Y."
2. **Define proof conditions before testing.** For each hypothesis, state:
   - what evidence would confirm it
   - what evidence would refute it
   - the fastest safe test
3. **Prefer tests that separate causes.** A useful hypothesis test distinguishes between plausible explanations. A test that only repeats the same symptom without narrowing the cause is weak evidence.
4. **Add targeted instrumentation if needed.** Insert a temporary log or assertion at the suspected root cause and read the output.
5. **Remove instrumentation.** Once the hypothesis is confirmed or refuted, remove all temporary logs and assertions before proceeding.
6. **Record the result in a hypothesis ledger.** Mark each hypothesis `CONFIRMED`, `REFUTED`, or `INCONCLUSIVE` with the evidence that decided it.
7. **Apply the 3-strike rule.** After three consecutive refuted hypotheses, stop. The root cause is either architectural or requires information not available in this context. Set status to `INCONCLUSIVE` and write the report documenting what was ruled out.

Move to a new hypothesis only after the current one is confirmed or refuted with evidence.

### Root Cause Chain

After a hypothesis is confirmed, trace it backward in this exact shape:

```
Symptom → immediate cause → contributing factor(s) → root cause
```

The root cause is the earliest actionable trigger inside the codebase or its configuration boundary. If the chain stops at the line where the error appeared, the report cannot be `CONFIRMED`; it is `PROBABLE` at best. Recommended Actions must target the root cause, not the symptom location.

## Phase 4: Persist & Handoff

1. **Constraint check.** Verify no source code changes remain from temporary investigation probes.
2. **Persist the report immediately** Call `kit_save_handoff(type: "investigation", content: <full investigation report markdown below>, slug: <short-issue-slug>)`.

```

## 📌 Executive Summary
* **Symptom:** [What was observed—error message, behavior, or steps to reproduce]
* **Root Cause:** [High-level mechanical explanation of what is wrong and why]
* **Blast Radius:** [Number of files] — [Systems or modules affected]
* **Verification Target:** [Exact command or manual reproduction step that demonstrates the bug before the fix and should pass after the fix]

### Prevention Needed
[State the minimal recurrence-prevention work the implementer should include. Every report must either name a prevention measure or explicitly state why none applies.]
* **Regression Coverage:** [Test or manual assertion that should fail before the fix and pass after]
* **Guard / Validation:** [Boundary check, type guard, timeout, transaction, or other prevention if applicable]
* **Observability:** [Log/error context that would make recurrence diagnosable, or "none needed"]

## 🔗 Metadata & Context
* **Related History:** [Prior bugs in the same area, TODOs, or architectural notes]
* **Investigation Path:** [Summarize the hypothesis ledger, especially refuted hypotheses future agents should not retry]
* **Hard Stop Notes:** [If Blast Radius > 5 files or reproduction was impossible, explain why here]
```

**Status definitions:**

- `CONFIRMED` — root cause traced to a specific condition and confirmed with direct evidence.
- `PROBABLE` — strong hypothesis supported by circumstantial evidence but not fully reproducible (e.g., intermittent issue, restricted environment).
- `INCONCLUSIVE` — 3-strike rule triggered; hypotheses exhausted without confirmation; report documents what was ruled out.

3. **Present execution menu** for `CONFIRMED` or `PROBABLE` reports:

```
✅ Investigation saved → `<returned-path>`

What would you like to do next?

1) Execute fix now  — Start /code with this Investigation Report
2) Done             — No further action
```

If status is `INCONCLUSIVE`, still save the report, but output only:

```
✅ Investigation saved → `<returned-path>`

Status is INCONCLUSIVE. Continue investigation before implementation.
```

## Hard Stops

Surface to the user when:

- **Blast radius exceeds 5 files.** The root cause touches more than 5 files — this likely indicates an architectural issue rather than a point bug. Note this in the report and recommend a planning session before any fix is attempted.
- **Reproduction is impossible.** The issue cannot be reproduced and the environment difference is unclear. Note the gap in the Evidence field and set status to `PROBABLE` or `INCONCLUSIVE`.
- **Root cause is in a dependency.** The bug originates in an external package or service outside the codebase. Document the finding and stop — do not trace further into the dependency.
