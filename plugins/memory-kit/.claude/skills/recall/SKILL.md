# Memory Recall

Search memory for context relevant to the user's question.

## Steps

1. Call `kit_memory_search` with the user's question (or a concise reformulation) as the query.
2. Review the returned results — assess relevance using score, heading, and content.
3. If results are relevant, return a concise summary citing source file and date.
4. If no relevant results, respond: "No relevant memories found."
